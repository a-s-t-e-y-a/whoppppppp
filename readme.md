# note to be noted

Access to a MongoDB 4.2+ server with a replica set deployment. We recommend using MongoDB Atlas.

The MongoDB database connector uses transactions to support nested writes. Transactions requires a replica set deployment. The easiest way to deploy a replica set is with Atlas. It's free to get started.
